## üëã Hello! Aspiring MERN Stack Developer Eager to Learn and Contribute!

Hi, I'm Mark John Humilde, a third-year Computer Science student with a genuine enthusiasm for web development, particularly within the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack**. I'm currently seeking internship opportunities to immerse myself in real-world projects and further refine my skills in **Frontend (React.js, styling with Tailwind CSS), Backend (building with Express.js and Node.js, managing data with MongoDB), or Full-Stack development**.

My current focus involves the **PASS COLLEGE OFFICIAL WEBSITE**, our thesis project, which is nearing completion on the frontend, and where I'm now deeply involved in building the backend infrastructure. This experience is providing invaluable lessons in the practical aspects of web development.

To enhance my frontend abilities, I'm actively exploring **Zustand** and **Redux** for better state management, and experimenting with **Framer Motion** to create smoother user interactions. I'm also dedicated to improving how I structure APIs, learning about **RESTful principles** and understanding different architectural patterns like **MVC for server-side rendering** and other approaches for client-side applications.

**What I'm currently working on and learning:**

* Gaining practical experience with the **MERN stack** through the **PASS COLLEGE OFFICIAL WEBSITE** project.
* Developing my skills in **React.js** and styling with **Tailwind CSS**.
* Learning to build robust backends using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.
* Exploring state management with **Zustand** and **Redux**.
* Experimenting with UI animations using **Framer Motion**.
* Improving my understanding of **RESTful API design** and different architectural patterns.

I'm eager to find an internship where I can contribute my enthusiasm and learn from experienced professionals in **Frontend, Backend, or Full-Stack roles**. I'm also open to **remote or part-time opportunities** that can help me grow my web development skillset.
