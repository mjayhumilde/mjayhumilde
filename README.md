## Hi there 👋

[![Portfolio](https://c063f90c.portfolio-8c1.pages.dev/favicon.ico)](https://c063f90c.portfolio-8c1.pages.dev/)

I'm Mark John Humilde, a passionate and driven third-year Computer Science student actively seeking internship opportunities to further develop my web development skills. I'm particularly interested in **Frontend (React.js, Tailwind CSS), Backend (Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js), and Full-Stack MERN development**. I'm open to **remote work** and **part-time positions** that will allow me to contribute to real-world projects and enhance my abilities.

Currently, I'm heavily involved in developing the **PASS COLLEGE OFFICIAL WEBSITE**, our thesis project, which is approximately 50-60% complete with the backend development being the primary focus now. This experience is providing me with valuable insights into the full software development lifecycle.

To further enhance my frontend capabilities, I'm actively learning **Zustand** and **Redux** for state management, as well as **Framer Motion** for creating engaging user interfaces. I'm also dedicated to improving my API architecture skills, focusing on **RESTful API design** and implementing both **MVC (Model-View-Controller) for server-side rendering** and **MV* (Model-View-Whatever) patterns for client-side rendering**.

**Here's a quick overview:**

- 🔭 Currently working on: **PASS COLLEGE OFFICIAL WEBSITE** (Thesis Project)
- 🌱 Currently learning: **Zustand**, **Redux**, and **Framer Motion**
- 💼 Seeking: **Frontend (React.js, Tailwind CSS), Backend (Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js), or Full-Stack MERN Internship**, **Remote Work**, or **Part-Time Opportunities**
